# Single Responsibility Principle

A class should have only one reason to change.

## Design Patterns

- **Repository Pattern**: Separates data access logic from business logic
- **Service Layer Pattern**: Encapsulates business logic in dedicated service classes
- **Facade Pattern**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem
