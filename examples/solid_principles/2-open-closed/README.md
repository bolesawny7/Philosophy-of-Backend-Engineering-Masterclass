# Open/Closed Principle

Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

## Design Patterns

- **Strategy Pattern**: Define a family of algorithms and make them interchangeable
- **Decorator Pattern**: Add new functionality without modifying existing code
- **Template Method Pattern**: Define skeleton of algorithm, let subclasses override steps
- **Factory Pattern**: Create objects without specifying exact class
