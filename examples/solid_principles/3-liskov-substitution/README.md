# Liskov Substitution Principle

Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application.

## Design Patterns

- **Factory Pattern**: Ensure proper object creation respecting LSP
- **Abstract Factory Pattern**: Create families of related objects correctly
- **Template Method Pattern**: Define common behavior in base class
- **Composition over Inheritance**: Favor composition to avoid LSP violations
