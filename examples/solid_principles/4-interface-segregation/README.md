# Interface Segregation Principle

No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.

## Design Patterns

- **Adapter Pattern**: Adapt interfaces to what clients need
- **Facade Pattern**: Provide simple interface to complex subsystem
- **Role Interface Pattern**: Create small, focused interfaces for specific roles
- **Proxy Pattern**: Provide surrogate with only needed functionality
