# Dependency Inversion Principle

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

## Design Patterns

- **Dependency Injection**: Inject dependencies rather than creating them
- **Factory Pattern**: Create objects through abstraction
- **Service Locator Pattern**: Central registry for service dependencies
- **Abstract Factory Pattern**: Create families of related objects via abstraction
- **Strategy Pattern**: Depend on strategy interface, not concrete strategies
